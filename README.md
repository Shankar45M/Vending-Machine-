# Vending-Machine
Objective:
Design a Python program to simulate a basic automated vending machine. The machine will 
dispense items based on user inputs, and the program will use for and while loops, along 
with break and continue statements, to control the flow of the vending process.
Scenario:
You are tasked with programming an automated vending machine. The machine sells three 
## items:
1. Item A - Price: $2
2. Item B - Price: $3
3. Item C - Price: $5
## The vending machine will:
1. Display the available items to the user.
2. Accept the user's selection and the amount of money they insert.
3. Dispense the item if the user inserts enough money.
4. Return the change if any.
5. If the user inserts insufficient money, prompt them to either insert more money or cancel 
the transaction.
6. Allow the user to exit the vending machine at any point by typing "exit."
